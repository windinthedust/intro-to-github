Initializing a repository creates the hidden .git files and makes git work inside that folder.  It does not create the first commit since
the user may not want to track all of the files in the current folder.  Additionally, if it created the first commit the user wouldn't 
be able to create a commit comment.  Therefore, git init just initializes the git structure and allows the user to start doing commits.
The user can issue a git status to see that there are no current commits and see what files haven't been staged yet.
